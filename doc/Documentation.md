## SD FILE
*Explanation to this file;
* If you are planning to modify this file and rename it to like "imamazinfdsdsdsfdpowa.txt" or something epicly similar, let me remind you that wont work
* No, I did not add some encryptic hax0rl3l code; 
*However if you are familiar with, the FAT System ("File Allocation Table"), you should know that the data file characters are only limited to 8 characters;
* LG:ST; If your file's name has more than 8 characters, It won't work..
* More Info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table


## Note;
for some apparent reason; Even though im new to this, if you execute file.read() in the sketch it will return -2
(in which case it returns for me...) or just something.
